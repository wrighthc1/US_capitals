##US Capitals
**By Hannah Wright**
<p> This project is a depiction of US Capitals and their corresponding population density by state. I created interaction allowing the user to mouse-over each state and view its name and population density information. Each capital is represented by a star symbol, I made sure to include a descriptive title, and I added a legend that shows the population density that correlates with each color on the map. The capitals are labelled on the base map itself, and I made sure to place my source information along with my name in the bottom right corner. </p>
